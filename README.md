## ▶️ About The Course

[cite_start]Is your design cycle slowed down by computationally expensive and time-consuming FEA simulations? [cite: 7] This course provides the solution. [cite_start]We will teach you how to build and deploy powerful machine learning 'digital twins' that capture the complex physics of electrical machines and deliver performance predictions in seconds, not hours. [cite: 8]

By mastering this skill, you will:
* [cite_start]**Gain Deeper Insights:** Rapidly analyze thousands of design variations to develop a more intuitive and agile workflow. [cite: 10]
* [cite_start]**Boost Innovation:** Replace simulation wait times with instantaneous feedback, allowing you to focus on engineering excellence. [cite: 11]
* [cite_start]**Unlock the Future:** Build the foundational modeling capability required for automated, multi-objective design optimization. [cite: 12]
